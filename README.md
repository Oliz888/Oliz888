### Project experience 💻 
##### 💡 [Network Analysis of Twitter to Identify Opinion Leader, Emotion Cascade and Community Structure](https://github.com/Oliz888/hk2019protest_network_analysis)
- Deployed K-core decomposition to examine the community structure, applied NLP including Name Entity
Recognition, Sentimental Analysis and Topic Modelling on tweets to investigate the emotion cascade
##### 💡 [How Consensus can be Involved through Innovating Voting Mechanism?](https://github.com/Oliz888/Voting_Consensus_Detection)
- Using PCA and UMAP to visualize the participants’ stance on a 2-dimensional map, uses Kmeans to cluster and classify group A and B,
and uses centroid coords calculation to get the distance between two groups. 
##### 💡 [Predicting Attitudes toward UBI in EU using Machine Learning Techniques](https://github.com/Oliz888/Predicting_UBI_Machine_Learning)
- Built and trained Logistic Regression, DecisionTree, SVM, RandomForest, XGBoost and GBDT to identify 5
primary indicators and 35 secondary indicators
the key influential factor on the attitude of EU citizen towards UBI
##### 💡 [Using DID to Evaluate the Impact of Intensive Case Management Services](https://github.com/Oliz888/Economics_and_Statistics)
- Designed DID to construct quasi-experiment setting for causal inference to quantify the impacts
##### 💡 [Can Remittances Compensate for Parental Absence? Evaluated by the Psychological Well- being and Educational Outcome](https://github.com/Oliz888/Economics_and_Statistics)
- Developed a multivariate model in STATA incorporating Difference-in-Difference and Propensity Score Matching
- Estimated the indirect effects and direct impacts of remittances in the context of parental work-related migration on 
the well-being and academic achievements of left-behind children.
